Things to do:

- When comparing Zverev to his contemporares, it would be nice to have a group devoted to the 'top 100 rank players' in gray. 
We see how Zverev ranks in relation to Djokovic, Fed, Nadal, etc but it would also be nice to see more concretely how he compares to
the remaining mortal ATP players.
